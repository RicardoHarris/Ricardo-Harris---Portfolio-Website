            <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>So far this website is my only project. This is (as you can probably <br />
            tell by now) my portfolio website! This site will inform you on all <br />
            of the things I've done when it comes to coding. My index page tells<br />
            you about me and leads you to different links to my projects page (this<br />
            page) and my technology page. My technology page will tell you about<br />
        all the cool programming tools I know how to use!</p>
