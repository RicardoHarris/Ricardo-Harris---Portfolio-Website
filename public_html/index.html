            <p>I am a student in the <a id="current-link" href="http://theappacademy.us">APP Academy</a> at Pasadena Highschool.
                This is my first website and first project; my portfolio!</p>

            <p>I was born March 10, 2000 in Glendale, California, USA. I spent my <br />
                childhood moving around from place to place in southern California <br />
                but I spent the majority of my childhood in Pasadena, CA. My first <br />
                experience with programming was in 8th grade Robotics class with <br />
                Mr.Crosby. There I had the help of his assistant Grant and my colleges <br />
                to learn how to and preform how to program NXT robots. My team won <br />
                second place in the annual robotics competition of PUSD (Pasadena Unified <br />
                School District). My school won every other trophy and medal. <br />
                Crosby was a very inspiring person, though he sugar coated nothing, <br />
                he opened my eyes to how this world works. I was taught that in  <br />
                this world there are producers and consumers. And I wanted to be <br />
                a producer. Now I'm off to the right track by entering the APP <br />
                Academy teaching me more advanced coding tools than C language such <br />
                as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am a programmer, and I'm preparing <br />
                for the future. In this world there are thinkers and there are doers.<br />
                And I ask myself "Why not be both?"</p>
